# Salary Range Prediction

## Overview
The **Salary Range Prediction** project aims to estimate the minimum and maximum salary for job listings using machine learning. This model helps employers, recruiters, and job seekers by providing salary insights based on job-related features.

## Project Objectives
- Develop a predictive model for salary range estimation.
- Improve recruitment efficiency and transparency.
- Enhance candidate experience with salary expectations.
- Provide insights for strategic HR decision-making.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, categorical encoding, and feature scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Insights into salary distribution, job categories, and industry trends.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implementing Regression and Classification models.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Measuring model performance using RMSE, MAE, R^2, and classification accuracy.
- **Visualization:** Power BI dashboard for salary analysis (optional).

## Dataset
The dataset contains job-related attributes, such as:
- Job title
- Company name
- Location
- Experience level
- Industry
- Required skills
- Salary range (min & max)

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Modeling:** Regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- **Dashboard (optional):** Power BI

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/salary-range-prediction.git
   cd salary-range-prediction
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Prepare the dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.
2. Run the preprocessing script:
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
   ```
3. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
4. Evaluate the model:
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py
   ```
5. (Optional) Visualize insights using Power BI.

## Model Performance
- **Best Performing Model:** [Model Name]
- **Accuracy:** [XX%]
- **RMSE:** [Value]
- **MAE:** [Value]

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with real-time job listing platforms.
- Inclusion of more job-specific features.
- Deployment as a web API for salary prediction.
